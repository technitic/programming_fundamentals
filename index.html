        <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
        <p>a programming language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate with computers—using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn our ideas into instructions computers can understand. Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.</p>
        <h2>What is a Program?</h2>
        <p>A program is set of instructions that are written in a well defined structure to solve a particular problem. Program can be written in programming languages like C, C++ etc</p>
        <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>1. Low level Languages</p>
        <p>2. High level Languages</p>
        <h2>High Level Language</h2>
        <p>1. Low level programming languages are the languages that are near to computer and far from human beings. These are understood by Computer easily and it is very difficult for humans to understand it</p>
        <p>Low level Languages have two types</p>
        <p>(a) Machine Language</p>
        <p>(b) Assembly Language</p>
        <h3>Machine Language</h3>
        <p>Machine language is the most basic language a computer understands, consisting of binary code (0s and 1s) that directly controls the hardware. It’s extremely fast but hard for humans to write and understand</p>
        <h3>Assembly Language</h3>
        <p>Assembly language is a step above machine language, using simple, human-readable codes (called mnemonics) like MOV, ADD, and SUB to represent machine instructions. While it’s easier to work with than binary, assembly language still requires detailed knowledge of the computer’s architecture and needs to be converted into machine language by an assembler for execution.</p>
        <h2>2. High Level Language</h2>
        <p>A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read, write, and understand. Unlike machine language and assembly, which are closely tied to a computer's hardware, high-level languages use more natural language-like syntax and abstract away the complex details of hardware management. Examples of high-level languages include Python, Java, and C++</p>
        <h2>Machine Language</h2>
        <p>Machine language is the most basic language a computer understands, consisting of binary code (0s and 1s) that directly controls the hardware. It’s extremely fast but hard for humans to write and understand</p>
